New profiles can be set up to connect through to things like project specific AWS accounts. Each profile will expire after a certain amount of time (8-72 hours), users will have to download a new profile once their certificates which are baked into the openvpn profiles expire. Source Code Management # GitHub GitHub is where we store our open source code. You need to be added to the Uk HomeOffice organisation to access most of our code. More documentation can be found here GitLab GitLab is where we store our more private code. Hosted in our ops cluster, you will need an office 365 account to get in via single sign on. Each project has its own group which are managed by members of that project. More in depth guides to gitlab can be found here . CI # Drone Drone is our CI tool for building and deploying applications. We have two instances, one for GitLab and one for GitHub . More instructions can be found here . Jenkins Jenkins is considered a legacy system and is not supported. Binary / Artefact Storage # Quay Quay is where store all of our open source container images. ECR We use AWS ECR to host our private container images for high availability and resiliency. For more information on how to use ECR see here Artifactory We use Artifactory as our internal binary repository store where projects can push build time artefacts and dependencies. Prior to the introduction of ECR, Docker images were also pushed here and can be accessed via https://docker.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk. Please note that we regularly remove container images that have not been downloaded in a year. Domain Name System (DNS) Pattern # To standardise on how services route their application traffic to the appropriate hosting platform and to offer consistency in how we approach DNS we have a standard DNS naming convention for services. In parallel to this, users need to also be aware of the limits on certificates and letsencrypt if they are wanting external TLS certificates for their services. For Non-production Services The following categories are something we would expect a service to specify: Service Name - The name of the service users or other services will attempt to consume i.e. web-portal Env - The environment of the service i.e. Dev Service - The overall service name or project name i.e. example-service <servicename>.<env>.<service>-notprod.homeoffice.gov.uk web-portal.dev.example-service-notprod.homeoffice.gov.uk For Production Services As we want to protect production services from hitting limits and to create a distinction between services that are non-production, (not prod) and production, we simplify the overall approach by using the main service name as the domain. Service Name - The name of the service users or other services will attempt to consume i.e. web-portal Service - The overall service name or project name i.e. example-service <servicename>.<service>.homeoffice.gov.uk web-portal.example-service.homeoffice.gov.uk Application Composition # The following are containers that we create for use alongside your own application Keycloak Gatekeeper Keycloak Proxy : a container for putting auth in front of your application. Nginx Proxy Nginx Proxy : for TLS and proxying your application container. cert-manager Cert-manager : for obtaining internal and external certificates. Logging # Logging stack consists of Elasticsearch , Logstash , Kibana ). Logstash agents deployed as a daemonSet will collect all workload logs and index them in Elasticsearch. Logs are searchable for a period of 5 days through Kibana UI . Access to view logs can be requested via Support request .

In addition to other technologies that we use, we strongly recommend to get an understanding of two of the core technologies that ACP is based on - Docker and Kubernetes: Docker is a software tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run applications by packaging up along with all its dependencies to containers. Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing container-centric infrastructure. For further information on Docker and Kubernetes: Docker Docker getting started tutorial Kubernetes What is Kubernetes? Kubernetes talk to introduce the concepts Developer getting started guide # Some prerequisites are required before developing on ACP. This guide will show you how to: Get access to the VPNs that allows you to connect to the platform Get setup with the kubectl client that lets you deploy applications to kubernetes Get access to Quay and Artifactory In addition, new developers should look at the new user flow documentation whilst going through this doc to serve as a checklist and make sure you are onboarded to all necessary platform services. Platform Hub # The Platform Hub serves as a central portal for users of ACP. It acts as an all-in-one place to find information, requests and also support for the platform. The hub also provides tools to develop, build, deploy and manage all your projects. Updates are also on its way to include more self-service tools, along with documentation, FAQs and live status updates. Access to the Platform Hub requires the Kube Platform VPN profile. Please make sure you have followed the Developer getting started guide for instructions on connecting to VPNs. Support Portal # All support requests, changes, incidents and announcements for ACP are managed via JIRA Service Desk .

Connecting to ACP VPN # Most of ACP's services operate behind a VPN which is accessible with an openvpn client. Instructions on installing openvpn for your OS can be found at OpenVPN Once you've got your Office 365 SSO credentials, you can now navigate to Remote Access and login with your Office 365 account by clicking on the link on the right. Please download the VPN profile named \"Kube Platform\" and use the openvpn client to connect. Verify that you can resolve the Platform Hub before continuing on. VPN profiles expire after 72 hours. You'll need to download and connect with a new VPN Profile when it expires. Platform Hub registration # Please note that you need to have your VPN running to access the Platform Hub and also talk to cluster APIs. You will need to register with the Platform Hub in order to gain access tokens for our Kubernetes clusters. Head to Platform Hub , you will need your O365 credentials to login/sign up. You will be asked to connect your Github account to your Platform Hub account. This will give you access to project repositories under the UKHomeOffice Organisation in GitHub. Navigate to the Support Portal (JIRA Service Desk), logging in via your O365 account, and create a support request for access to ACP Induction . The support request will be sent to and reviewed by a member of the ACP team. Any updates on the request will be available to view within the Support Portal and additionally emailed to you. Please note that if you have an AD-only email account (a digital account without a mailbox), then you can raise a support request to update your email address so that you can receive email notifications on ticket updates. If you find that you cannot raise support requests, this may be because you have not been added to a team yet. Please ask one of your team members who already has access to the support portal to raise a request to have you added to service desk . Once created, your token will be shown in the Platform Hub under the Kubernetes section of the Connected Identities tab on the sidebar. You can view all of your tokens by pressing the Show Tokens button. Add a ssh key to Gitlab # You will need to add a ssh public key to your Gitlab profile before attending the Induction.

Kubernetes Pod Autoscaling # For full documentation on kubernetes autoscaling feature please go here . As of writing the ACP cluster supports standard autoscaling based on a CPU metric, there are however plans to support custom-metrics in the near future. Assuming you have a deployment 'web' and you wish to autoscale the deployment when it hit's a 40% CPU usage with min/max of 5/10 pods. apiVersion: autoscaling/v1 kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: web spec: maxReplicas: 10 minReplicas: 5 scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Deployment name: web metrics: - type: Resource resource: name: cpu targetAverageUtilization: 50 Sysdig Metrics - Experimental The autoscaler can also consume and make scaling decisions from sysdig metrics. Note, this feature is currently experimental but tested as working. An example of sysdig would be scaling on http_request apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta1 kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: autoscaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Deployment name: myapplication minReplicas: 3 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: Object object: target: kind: Service name: myservice metricName: net.http.request.count targetValue: 100 Chisel # The Problem : we want to provide services running in ACP access to the third party services as well as the ability to have user-based access controls. At present network access in ACP is provided via Calico, but this becomes redundant when the traffic egresses the cluster. Simply peering networks together either through VPC peering or VPN connections doesn't provide the controls we want. We could rely on user-authentication on third-party service but not all services are authenticated (take POISE) and beyond that peering networks provides no means of auditing traffic that is traversing the bridged networks. One pattern we are exploring is the use of a proxy cluster with an authenticated side-kick to route traffic and provide end-to-end encryption. Both ACP Notprod and Prod are peered to an respective proxy cluster that is running a Chisel server. Below is rough idea of how the chisel service works. The workflow for this is as follows, note the following example is assuming we have peered with a network in the proxy cluster which is exposing x services. A request via BAU the provisioning of a service on the Chisel server. Once done user is provided credentials for service. You add into your deployment a chisel container running in client mode and add the configuration as described to route the traffic. In regard to DNS and hostnames, kubernetes pods permit the user to add host entries into the container DNS, enabling you to override. The traffic is picked up, encrypted over an ssh tunnel and pushed to the Chisel server where the user credentials are evaluated. Assuming everything is ok the traffic is then proxied on to destination. A Working Example We have a two services called example-api.internal.homeoffice.gov.uk and another-service.example.com and we wish to consume the API from the pods. Lets assume the service has already been provisioned on the Chisel server and we have the credentials at hand. kind: Deployment metadata: name: consumer spec: replicas: 1 template: metadata: labels: name: consumer spec: hostAliases: - hostnames: - another-service.example.com - example-api.internal.homeoffice.gov.uk ip: 127.0.0.1 securityContext: fsGroup: 1000 volumes: - name: bundle configMap: name: bundle containers: - name: consumer image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/someimage:someversion - name: chisel image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/chisel:v1.3.1 # Both Chisel Client & Server versions must match securityContext: runAsNonRoot: true env: # essentially user:password - name: AUTH valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: chisel key: chisel.auth # this optional BUT recommended this is fingerprint for the SSH service - name: CHISEL_KEY valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: chisel key: chisel.key args: - client - -v # this the chisel endpoint service hostname - gateway-internal.px.notprod.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk:443 # this is saying listen on port 10443 and route all traffic to another-service.example.com:443 endpoint - 127.0.0.1:10443:another-service.example.com:443 - 127.0.0.1:10444:example-api.internal.homeoffice.gov.uk:443 volumeMounts: - name: bundle mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs readOnly: true The above embeds the sidekick into the Pod and requests the client to listen on localhost:10443 and 10444 to redirect traffic via the Chisel service. The one annoying point here is the port requirements, placing things on different ports, but unfortunately this is required. You should be able to call the service via curl https://another-service.example.com:10443 at this point. Debug Issues with your deployments # Debug with secrets Sometimes your app doesn't want to talk to an API or a DB and you've stored the credentials or just the details of that in secret. The following approaches can be used to validate that your secret is set correctly $ kubectl exec -ti my-pod -c my-container -- mysql -h\\$DBHOST -u\\$DBUSER -p\\$DBPASS ## or $ kubectl exec -ti my-pod -c my-container -- openssl verify /secrets/certificate.pem ## or $ kubectl exec -ti my-pod -c my-container bash ## and you'll naturally have all the environment variables set and volumes mounted. ## however we recommend against outputing them to the console e.g. echo $DBHOST ## instead if you want to assert a variable is set correctly use $ [[ -z $DBHOST ]]; echo $? ## if it returns 1 then the variable is set. Debugging issues with your deployments to the platform If you get to the end of the above guide but can't access your application there are a number of places something could be going wrong. This section of the guide aims to give you some basic starting points for how to debug your application. Debugging deployments We suggest the following steps: 1. Check your deployment, replicaset and pods created properly $ kubectl get deployments $ kubectl get rs $ kubectl get pods 2. Investigate potential issues with your pods (this is most likely) If the get pods command shows that your pods aren't all running then this is likely where the issue is. You can then try curling your application to see if it is alive and responding as expected. e.g. $ curl localhost:4000 You can get further details on why the pods couldn't be deployed by running: $ kubectl describe pods *pods_name_here* If your pods are running you can check they are operating as expected by exec ing into them (this gets you a shell on one of your containers). $ kubectl exec -ti *pods_name_here* -c *container_name_here* /bin/sh Please note that the -c argument isn't needed if there is only one container in the pod.* 3. Investigate potential issues with your service A good way to do this is to run a container in your namespace with a bash terminal: $ kubectl run -ti --image quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/centos-base debugger bash From this container you can then try curling your service. Your service will have a nice DNS name by default, so you can for example run: $ curl my-service-name 4. Investigate potential issues with ingress Minikube runs an ingress service using nginx. It's possible to ssh into the nginx container and cat the nginx.conf to inspect the configuration for nginx. In order to attach to the nginx container, you need to know the name of the container: $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE default-http-backend-2kodr 1/1 Running 1 5d acp-hello-world-3757754181-x1kdu 1/1 Running 2 6d ingress-3879072234-5f4uq 1/1 Running 2 5d You can attach to the running container with: $ kubectl exec -ti <ingress-3879072234-5f4uq> -c <proxy> bash where <proxy> is the container name of the nginx proxy inside the pod. You can find the name by describing the pod. You're inside the container. You can cat the nginx.conf with: $ cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf You can also inspect the logs with: $ kubectl logs <ingress-3879072234-5f4uq> DMS Migration # Prerequisite The following need to be true before you follow this guide: * AWS console logon * Access to the DMS service from console * A region where STS has been activated DMS Setup Login to the AWS console using your auth, switch to a role with the correct access policies and verify you're in the right region. Next, select DMS from the services on the main dashboard to access the data migration home screen. Under the \"Get started\" section click on the \"create migration\" button then next to the Replication instance. You should see the following screen: The following are the options and example answers for the replication instance: Option Example answer Description Name dev-team-dms A name for the replication image. This name should be unique. Description DMS instance for migration Brief description of the instance Instance class dms.t2.medium The class of replication resource with the configuration you need for your migration. VPC vpc-* The virtual private cloud resource where you wish to add your dms instance. This should be as close to both the source and target instance as possible. Multi-AZ No Optional parameter to create a standby replica of your replication instance in another Availability Zone. Used for failover. Publicly Accessible False Option to access your instance from the internet You won't need to set any of the advanced settings. To create the instance click on the next button. You should now see a screen like this: The following are the options and example answers for the endpoints instances: Option Example answer Description Endpoint identifer database-source/target This is the name you use to identify the endpoint. Source/target engine postgres Choose the type of database engine that for this endpoint. Server name mysqlsrvinst.abcd123456789.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com Type of server name. For an on-premises database, this can be the IP address or the public hostname. For an Amazon RDS DB instance, this can be the endpoint for the DB instance. Port 5432 The port used by the database. SSL mode None SSL mode for encryption for your endpoints. Username root The user name with the permissions required to allow data migration. Password * * The password for the account with the required permissions. Database Name (target) dev-db The name of the attached database to the selected endpoint. Repeat these options for both source and target and make sure to test connection before clicking next. You might need to append security group rules to allow the replication instance access, for example: Replication instance has internal ip address 10.20.0.0 and the RDS is on port 5432 and uses TCP. Append rule Type Procol Port Range Source Custom TCP rule TCP 5432 Custom 10.20.0.0/32 Once this has fully been setup click next and you should be able to view the tasks page: The following are the options and example answers for these tasks: Option Example answer Description Task name Migration-task A name for the task. Task Description Task for migrating A description for the task. Source endpoint source-instance The source endpoint for migration. Target endpoint target-instance The target endpoint for migration. Replication instance replication-instance The replication instance to be used. Migration type Migrate existing data Migration method you want to use. Start task on create True When selected the task begins as soon as it is created. Target table preparation Drop table on target Migration strategy on target. Include LOB columns in replication Limited LOB mode Migration of large objects on target. Max LOB size 32 kb Maximum size of large objects. Enable logging False When selected migration events are logged. After completion the job will automatically run if \"start task on create\" has been selected. If not, the job can be started in the tasks section by selecting it and clicking on the \"Start/Resume\" button. Downscaling Services Out Of Hours # In an effort to reduce costs on running the platform, we've enabled the capability to scale down specific resources Out Of Hours (OOH) for Non-Production and Production environments. AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) RDS resources can be transitioned to a stopped state OOH to save on resource utilisation costs. This is currently managed with the use of tags on the RDS instance defining a cronjob schedule to stop and start the instance. To set a schedule for your RDS instances, please use the related Support Portal support request template . Note: Shutting down an RDS instance will have cost savings based on the instance size, however you will still be charged for the allocated storage. Kubernetes Pods Automatically scale down Kubernetes Deployments & Statefulsets to 0 replicas during non-working hours for Non-Production or Production Environments. Downscaling for Deployments & Statefulsets are managed by an annotation set within the manifest, and are processed every 30 seconds for changes, by a service running within the Kubernetes Clusters. Usage Set ONE of the following annotations on your Deployment / Statefulset: - downscaler/uptime : A time schedule in which the Deployment should be scaled up - downscaler/downtime : A time schedule in which the Deployment should be scaled down to 0 replicas The annotation values for the timeframe must have the following format to be processed correctly: <WEEKDAY-FROM>-<WEEKDAY-TO-INCLUSIVE> <HH>:<MM>-<HH>:<MM> <TIMEZONE> For example, to schedule a Deployment to only run on weekdays during working hours, the following annotation would be set: downscaler/uptime: Mon-Fri 09:00-17:30 Europe/London Note: When the deployment is downscaled, an additional annotation downscaler/original-replicas is automatically set to retain a history of the desired replicas prior to the downscale action. If this annotation has been deleted before the service is automatically scaled back up, the downscaler service will not know what to set the replicas back to, and so it won't attempt to scale up the resource.

Drone How To # Install Drone CLI Github drone instance: https://drone.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk/ Gitlab drone instance: https://drone-gitlab.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk/ Download and install the Drone CLI . At the time of writing, we are using version 0.8 of Drone. You can also install a release from Drone CLI's GitHub repo . Once you have downloaded the relevant file, extract it and move it to the /usr/local/bin directory. Verify it works as expected: $ drone --version drone version 0.8.0 Export the DRONE_SERVER and DRONE_TOKEN variables. You can find your token on Drone by clicking the icon in the top right corner and going to Token . export DRONE_SERVER=https://drone.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk export DRONE_TOKEN=<your_drone_token> If your installation is successful, you should be able to query the current Drone instance: $ drone info User: youruser Email: youremail@gmail.com If the output is bash Error: you must provide the Drone server address. or Error: you must provide your Drone access token. Please make sure that you have exported the DRONE_SERVER and DRONE_TOKEN variables properly. Activate your pipeline Once you are logged in to Drone, you will find a list of repos by clicking the icon in the top right corner and going to Repositories . Sync your repository access rights with Drone by clicking the icon in the top right corner again with the Synchronize button - this needs to be applied everytime when a new repository is created. Select the repo you want to activate. Navigate to your repository's settings in Github (or Gitlab) and you will see a webhook has been created. You need to update the url for the newly created web hook so that it matches this pattern: https://drone-external.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk/hook?access_token=some_token If it is already in that format there is no need to change anything. The token in the payload url will not be the same as the personal token that you exported and it should be left unchanged. Please note that this does not apply to Gitlab. When you activate the repo in Drone, you should not change anything for a Gitlab repo. Configure your pipeline In the root folder of your project, create a .drone.yml file with the following content: pipeline: my-build: image: docker:18.03 environment: - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 commands: - docker build -t <image_name> . when: branch: master event: push Commit and push your changes: $ git add .drone.yml $ git commit $ git push origin master Please note you should replace the name <...> with the name of your app. You should be able to watch your build succeed in the Drone UI. Publishing Docker images Publishing to Quay If your repository is hosted on Gitlab, you don't want to publish your images to Quay. Images published to Quay are public and can be inspected and downloaded by anyone. You should publish your private images to Artifactory . Register for a free Quay account using your Github account linked to the Home Office organisation. Once you've logged into Quay check that you have ukhomeofficedigital under Users and Organisations. If you do not, submit a support request on the support portal for access to the ukhomeoffice organisation . Once you have access to view the ukhomeofficedigital repositories, click repositories and click the + Create New Repositories that is: public empty - no need to create a repo from a Dockerfile or link it to an existing repository Add your project to the UKHomeOffice Quay account and submit a support request on the support portal for a new Quay robot . Add the step to publish the docker image to Quay in your Drone pipeline: image_to_quay: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/drone-docker secrets: - docker_password environment: - DOCKER_USERNAME=ukhomeofficedigital+<your_robot_username> registry: quay.io repo: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/<your_quay_repo> tags: - ${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} - latest when: branch: master event: push Where <your_quay_repo> in: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/<your_quay_repo> is the name of the Quay repo you (should) have already created. Note: ${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} is a Drone environment variable that is passed to the container at runtime. The build should fail with the following error: Error response from daemon: Get https://quay.io/v2/: unauthorized: Could not find robot with username: ukhomeofficedigital+<your_robot_username> and supplied password. The error points to the missing password for the Quay robot. You will need to add this as a drone secret. You can do this through the Drone UI by going to your repo, clicking the menu icon in the top right and then clicking Secrets . You should be presented with a list of the secrets for that repo (if there are any) and you should be able to add secrets giving them a name and value. Add a secret with the name DOCKER_PASSWORD and with the value being the robot token that was supplied to you. Alternatively, you can use the Drone CLI to add the secret: $ drone secret add --repository ukhomeoffice/<your_github_repo> --name DOCKER_PASSWORD --value <your_robot_token> Restarting the build should be enough to make it pass. The Drone CLI allows for more control over the secret as opposed to the UI. For example, the CLI allows you to specify the image and the events that the secret will be allowed to be used with. Also note that the secret was specified in the secrets section of the pipeline to give it access to the secret. Without this, the pipeline would not be able to use the secret and it would fail. Secrets in this section are automatically uppercased at runtime so it is important that the secret is uppercased in your commands. You can also push specifically tagged images by using the DRONE_TAG Drone environment variable and by using the tag event: tagged_image_to_quay: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/drone-docker secrets: - docker_password environment: - DOCKER_USERNAME=ukhomeofficedigital+<your_robot_username> registry: quay.io repo: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/<your_quay_repo> tags: - ${DRONE_TAG} when: event: tag Tag using git tag v1.0 and push your tag with git push origin v1.0 (replace v1.0 with the tag you actually want to use). Note: These pipeline configurations are using the Docker plugin for Drone. For more information, see http://plugins.drone.io/drone-plugins/drone-docker/ Publishing to Artifactory Images hosted on Artifactory are private. If your repository is hosted publicly on GitHub, you shouldn't publish your images to Artifactory. Artifactory is only used to publish private images. You should use Quay to publish your public images . Submit a support request for a new Artifactory access token . You should be supplied an access token in response. You can inject the token that has been supplied to you with: $ drone secret add --repository <gitlab_repo_group>/<your_gitlab_repo> --name DOCKER_PASSWORD --value <your_robot_token> You can add the following step in your .drone.yml : image_to_artifactory: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/drone-docker secrets: - docker_password environment: - DOCKER_USERNAME=<your_robots_username> registry: docker.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk repo: docker.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/<your_artifactory_repo> tags: - ${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} - latest when: branch: master event: push Where the <image_name> in: docker tag <image_name> docker.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/ukhomeofficedigital/<your_artifactory_repo>:$${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} is the name of the image you tagged previously in the build step. The image should now be published on Artifactory. Please note that we regularly remove container images that have not been downloaded in a year. Deployments Deployments and promotions Create a step that runs only on deployments: deploy-to-preprod: image: busybox commands: - /bin/echo hello preprod when: environment: preprod event: deployment Push the changes to your remote repository. You can deploy the build you just pushed with the following command: $ drone deploy ukhomeoffice/<your_repo> 16 preprod Where 16 is the successful build number on drone that you wish to deploy to the preprod environment. You can pass additional parameters to your deployment as environment variables: $ drone deploy ukhomeoffice/<your_repo> 16 preprod -p DEBUG=1 -p NAME=Dan and use them in the step like this: deploy-to-preprod: image: busybox commands: - /bin/echo hello $${NAME} when: environment: preprod event: deployment Environments are strings and can be set to any value. When you wish to deploy to several environments you can create a step for each one of them: deploy-to-preprod: image: busybox commands: - /bin/echo hello preprod when: environment: preprod event: deployment deploy-to-prod: image: busybox commands: - /bin/echo hello prod when: environment: prod event: deployment And deploy them accordingly: $ drone deploy ukhomeoffice/<your_repo> 16 preprod $ drone deploy ukhomeoffice/<your_repo> 16 prod Read more on environments . Drone as a Pull Request builder Drone pipelines are triggered when events occurs. Event triggers can be as simple as a push , a tagged commit , a pull request or as granular as only for pull requests for a branch named test . You can limit the execution of build steps at runtime using the when block. As an example, this block executes only on pull requests: pr-builder: image: docker:18.03 environment: - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 commands: - docker build -t <image_name> . when: event: pull_request Drone will only execute that step when a new pull request is raised (and when pushes are made to the branch while a pull request is open). Read more about Drone conditions . Deploying to ACP Please note that this section assumes that you already have kube files to work with (specifically, deployment, service and ingress files). Examples of these files can be found in the kube-signed-commit-check project. Add a deployment script with the following: #!/bin/bash export KUBE_NAMESPACE=<dev-induction> export KUBE_SERVER=${KUBE_SERVER} export KUBE_TOKEN=${KUBE_TOKEN} kd -f deployment.yaml \\ -f service.yaml \\ -f ingress.yaml Please note that this is only an example script and it will need to be changed to fit your particular application's needs. If you deployed this now you would likely receive an error similar to this: error: You must be logged in to the server (the server has asked for the client to provide credentials) This error appears because kd needs 3 environment variables to be set before deploying: KUBE_NAMESPACE - The kubernetes namespace you wish to deploy to. You need to provide the kubernetes namespace as part of the deployment job . KUBE_TOKEN - This is the token used to authenticate against the kubernetes cluster. If you do not already have a kube token, here are docs explaining how to get one . KUBE_SERVER - This is the address of the kubernetes cluster that you want to deploy to. You will need to add KUBE_TOKEN and KUBE_SERVER as drone secrets. Information about how to add Drone secrets can be found in the publishing to Quay section . You can verify that the secrets for your repo are present with: $ drone secret ls --repository ukhomeoffice/<your-repo> Once the secrets have been added, add a new step to your drone pipeline that will execute the deployment script: deploy_to_uat: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/kd:v0.11.0 secrets: - kube_server - kube_token commands: - ./deploy.sh when: environment: uat event: deployment Using Another Repo It is possible to access files or deployment scripts from another repo, there are two ways of doing this. The recommended method is to clone another repo in the current repo (since this only requires maintaining one .drone.yml) using the following step: predeploy_to_uat: image: plugins/git commands: - git clone https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}:x-oauth-basic@github.com/UKHomeOffice/<your_repo>.git when: environment: uat event: deployment Your repository is saved in the workspace, which in turn is shared among all steps in the pipeline. However, if you decide that you want to trigger a completely different pipeline on a separate repository, you can leverage the drone-trigger plugin. If you have a secondary repository, you can setup Drone on that repository like so: pipeline: deploy_to_uat: image: busybox commands: - echo ${SHA} when: event: deployment environment: uat Once you are ready, you can push the changes to the remote repository. In your main repository you can add the following step: trigger_deploy: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/drone-trigger:latest drone_server: https://drone.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk repo: UKHomeOffice/<deployment_repo> branch: <master> deploy_to: <uat> params: SHA=${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} when: event: deployment environment: uat The settings are very similar to the drone deploy command: deploy_to is the environment constraint params is a list of comma separated list of arguments. In the command line tool, this is equivalent to -p PARAM1=ONE -p PARAM2=TWO repo the repository where the deployment scripts are located The next time you trigger a deployment on the main repository with: $ drone deploy UKHomeOffice/<your_repo> 16 uat This will trigger a new deployment on the second repository. Please note that in this scenario you need to inspect 2 builds on 2 separate repositories if you just want to inspect the logs. Versioned deployments When you restart your build, Drone will automatically use the latest version of the code. However always using the latest version of the deployment configuration can cause major issues and isn't recommended. For example when promoting from preprod to prod you want to use the preprod version of the deployment configuration. If you use the latest it could potentially break your production environment, especially as it won't necessarily have been tested. To counteract this you should use a specific version of your deployment scripts. In fact, you should git checkout the tag or sha as part of your deployment step. Here is an example of this: predeploy_to_uat: image: plugins/git commands: - git clone https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}:x-oauth-basic@github.com/UKHomeOffice/<your_repo>.git when: environment: uat event: deployment deploy_to_uat: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/kd:v0.11.0 secrets: - kube_server - kube_token commands: - apk update && apk add git - git checkout v1.1 - ./deploy.sh when: environment: uat event: deployment Migrating your pipeline Secrets and Signing It is no longer necessary to sign your .drone.yml so the .drone.yml.sig can be deleted. Secrets can be defined in the Drone UI or using the CLI. Secrets created using the UI will be available to push, tag and deployment events. To restrict to selected events, or to allow pull request builds to access secrets you must use the CLI. Pipelines by default do not have access to any Drone secrets that you have added. You must now define which secrets a pipeline is allowed access to in a secrets section in your pipeline. Here is an example of a pipeline that has access to the DOCKER_PASSWORD secret which will be used to push an image to Quay: image_to_quay: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/drone-docker secrets: - docker_password environment: - DOCKER_USERNAME=ukhomeofficedigital+<your_robot_username> registry: quay.io repo: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/<your_quay_repo> tags: - latest when: branch: master event: push Note: Secrets names in the secrets section will have their names uppercased at runtime. Organisation secrets are no longer available. This means that if you are using any organisation secrets such as KUBE_TOKEN_DEV , you will need to add a secret in Drone to replace it. Docker-in-Docker The Docker-in-Docker (dind) service is no longer required. Instead, change the Docker host to DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 in the environment section of your pipline, and you will be able to access the shared Docker server on the drone agent. Note that it is only possible to run one Docker build at a time per Drone agent. Since privileged mode was primarily used for docker in docker, you should remove the privileged: true line from your .drone.yml . You can also use your freshly built image directly and run commands as part of your pipeline. Example: pipeline: build_image: image: docker:18.03 environment: - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 commands: - docker build -t hello_world . when: branch: master event: push test_image: image: hello_world commands: - ./run-hello-world.sh when: branch: master event: push Services If you use the services section of your .drone.yml it is possible to reference them using the DNS name of the service. For example, if using the following section: services: database: image: mysql The mysql server would be available on tcp://database:3306 Variable Escaping Any Drone variables (secrets and environment variables) must now be escaped by having two $$ instead of one. Examples: ${DOCKER_PASSWORD} --> $${DOCKER_PASSWORD} ${DRONE_TAG} --> $${DRONE_TAG} ${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} --> $${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} Scanning Images in Drone # ACP provides Anchore as a scanning solution for images built into the Drone pipeline, allowing users to scan both ephemeral (built within the context of the drone, but not pushed to a repository yet) as well as any public images. Example pipeline: pipeline: build: image: docker:17.09.0-ce environment: - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 commands: - docker build -t docker.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/myimage:$${DRONE_BUILD_NUMBER} . scan: # The location of the drone plugin image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/anchore-submission:latest # The optional path of a Dockerfile dockerfile: Dockerfile # Note the lack of double $ here (due to the way drone injects variables) image_name: docker.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/myimage:${DRONE_BUILD_NUMBER} # Indicates the image is locally available local_image: true # This indicates we are willing tolerate any vulnerabilities which are below medium (valid values: negligible, low, medium, high, critical) tolerate: medium # An optional whitelist (comma separated list of CVE's) whitelist: CVE_SOMENAME_1,CVE_SOMENAME_2 # An optional whitelist file containing a list of CSV relative to the repo path whitelist_file: <PATH> # Indicates we should show all vulnerabilities regardless show_all_vulnerabilities: false # By default the plugin will exit will fail if any vulnerabilities are discovered which are not tolerated, # you change this behaviour by setting the below fail_on_detection: false Q&As Q: The build fails with \"ERROR: Insufficient privileges to use privileged mode\" A: Remove privileged: true from your .drone.yml . As explained in the migrating your pipeline section , the primary use of this was for Docker-in-Docker which is not required. Q: The build fails with \"Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?\" A: Make sure that your steps contain the environment variable DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 like in this case: my-build: image: docker:18.03 environment: - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 commands: - docker build -t <image_name> . when: branch: master event: push Q: The build fails when uploading to Quay with the error \"Error response from daemon: Get https://quay.io/v2/: unauthorized:...\" A: This is likely because the secret wasn't added correctly or the password is incorrect. Check that the secret has been added to Drone and that you have added the secrets section in your .drone.yaml it to the pipeline that requires it. Q: As part of my build process I have two Dockerfiles to produce a Docker image. How can I share files between builds in the same step? A: When the pipeline starts, Drone creates a Docker data volume that is passed along all active steps in the pipeline. If the first step creates a test.txt file, the second step can use that file. As an example, this pipeline uses a two step build process: pipeline: first-step: image: busybox commands: - echo hello > test.txt when: branch: master event: push second-step: image: busybox commands: - cat test.txt when: branch: master event: push Q: Should I use Gitlab with Quay? A: Please don't. If your repository is hosted in Gitlab then use Artifactory to publish your images. Images published to Artifactory are kept private. If you still want to use Quay, you should consider hosting your repository on the open (Github). Q: Can I create a token that has permission to create ephemeral/temporary namespaces? A: No. This is because there is currently no way to give access to namespaces via regex. I.e. There is no way to give access to any namespace with the format: my-temp-namespace-* (where * would be build number or something similar). Alternatively, you can be given a named namespace in the CI cluster. Please create an issue on our Support Portal if you require this. AWS ECR for Private Docker Images # AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) is now available as a self-service feature via the Platform Hub. Each project has the capability to create their own Docker Repositories and define individual access to each via the use of IAM Credentials. Creating a Docker Repository Anybody that is part of a Project within the Platform Hub will have the ability to create a new Docker Repository. Login to the Platform Hub via https://hub.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk Navigate to the Projects list: https://hub.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk/projects/list Select your Project from the list to go to the detail page (e.g. https://hub.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk/projects/detail/acp) Ensure you have a Service defined within your Project for the Docker Repository to be associated with (check under the SERVICES tab) Select the ALL DOCKER REPOS tab Select the REQUEST NEW DOCKER REPO button Choose the Service to associate this Repository with and provide the name of the Repository to be created (e.g. hello-world-app ) The request to create a new Docker Repository can take a few seconds to complete. You can view the status of a Repository by navigating to the ALL DOCKER REPOS tab and viewing the list. Once the request has completed, your Repository should have the Active label associated with it. This repository won't automatically refresh, but you can hit the REFRESH button above the Repository list or just manually refresh your browser window for updates. Generating Access Credentials Access to ECR Repositories is managed via AWS IAM. These IAM credentials are generated via the Platform Hub and access can be managed per user, per Docker Repository. Navigate to the ALL DOCKER REPOS tab for your Project within the Platform Hub For the Repository you have created, select the MANAGE ACCESS button At this stage, you can: Create a Robot Account(s), which can be used in deployment pipelines in Drone CI for publishing new images to AWS ECR Select which Project Members have the ability to pull images, and additionally push updates using their own IAM credentials (separate to the Robot Account(s) and CI builds) For this example, select your own User and press Save . Note: Generally users should never be granted write access, as any write actions should be performed via CI (using the Robot Accounts). Press the REFRESH button at the top of the page and check the User Access has a status of active Robot Accounts are visible under the Docker Repository, and once they reveal an active status the IAM Credentials are displayed alongside it. Accessing a Docker Repository Accessing the AWS Container Registry to Pull & Push images is currently a two-step process: 1. Use IAM Credentials to generate a temporary authorisation token 1. Use the temporary authorisation token to authenticate your docker client with ECR Note: The authorisation token generated for docker login is only valid for 12 hours, and so the process above will need to be repeated. Pre-Requisites To follow the below steps you must have: * AWS CLI (version 1.11.91 or above, check with aws --version ) * Install Guides: Linux , OSX , Windows * Docker (version 17.06 or above, check with docker --version ) Step 1: Retrieve an authorisation token Navigate to the Connected Identities page: https://hub.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk/identities Under Amazon ECR you will have access to your own personal IAM Credentials. These credentials will work across multiple projects whose Repositories you have been granted access to. With the AWS IAM Credentials retrieved from the Connected Identities page, setup a local IAM Profile via the Terminal: $ aws configure --profile acp-ecr AWS Access Key ID [None]: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX AWS Secret Access Key [None]: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Default region name [None]: eu-west-2 Default output format [None]: json $ export AWS_PROFILE=acp-ecr Now, using the aws-cli you can request an authorisation token to perform a docker login: $ aws ecr get-login --no-include-email docker login -u AWS -p <long-auth-token> https://340268328991.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com Step 2: Login with Authorisation Token Following a successful ecr get-login , a full docker login command should be returned. Copy and paste the command exactly, to login to the ECR endpoint: $ docker login -u AWS -p <long-auth-token> https://340268328991.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com WARNING! Using --password via the CLI is insecure. Use --password-stdin. Login Succeeded Note: If you get an error from Step 1 such as Unknown options: --no-include-email , your aws-cli client needs updating. You can omit --no-include-email rather than updating your aws-cli client, but the resulting docker login command will include a deprecated -e none flag (needs to be removed prior to running the command). Pulling & Pushing Images Within the ACP Kubernetes Clusters, you do not need to provide an imagePullSecret as was previously required for images in Artifactory. The ACP Clusters will authenticate behind-the-scenes and be able to successfully pull images from any Docker Repositories you create via the Platform Hub. The Docker Repositories section of the Platform Hub will provide a URL such as follows for the Repository you have created: 340268328991.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/acp/hello-world-app Now that you have locally authenticated with AWS ECR, you can pull and push (if write access was granted) images as normal: $ docker build . -t 340268328991.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/acp/hello-world-app:v0.0.1 Sending build context to Docker daemon 32.78MB ...

For example: $ aws ecr list-images --repository-name acp/hello-world-app { \"imageIds\": [ { \"imageDigest\": \"sha256:0309d2655ecef6b4181ee93edfb91f386fc2ebc7849cc88f6e7a18b0d349c35f\", \"imageTag\": \"v0.0.1\" }, { \"imageDigest\": \"sha256:0309d2655ecef6b4181ee93edfb91f386fc2ebc7849cc88f6e7a18b0d349c35f\", \"imageTag\": \"latest\" } ] } To delete old images, you must have write access enabled or perform the action via a Robot Account. Images can be deleted based on a provided tag or digest.

Instead, you would need to store the IAM Credentials for a Robot Account as Drone Secrets and perform the aws ecr get-login + docker login .. step on each build. To simplify this process you can use a custom Drone ECR plugin, which: - Builds a docker image in the root repository directory, with custom build arguments passed in (optional) - Authenticates to ECR using your AWS IAM credentials (stored as Drone Secrets) - Pushes the image to ECR with the given tags in the list (latest and commit sha) Example Pipeline: pipeline: build_push_to_ecr: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/ecr:latest secrets: - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY repo: 340268328991.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/acp/hello-world-app build_args: - APP_BUILD=${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} tags: - latest - ${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} The UKHomeOffice ECR image above is based off the official Docker ECR Plugin , with amendments to run in ACP Drone CI. Using Ingress # An Ingress is a type of Kubernetes resource that allows you to expose your services outside the cluster. It gets deployed and managed exactly like other Kube resources. Our ingress setup offers two different ingresses based on how restrictively you want to expose your services: - internal - only people within the VPN can access services - external - anyone with internet access can access services The annotation kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \"nginx-internal\" is used to specify whether the ingress is internal. ( kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \"nginx-external\" is used for an external ingress.) In the following example the terms \"myapp\" and \"myproject\" have been used, these will need to be changed to the relevant names for your project. Where internal is used, this can be changed for an external ingress - everything else stays the same. apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: annotations: # used to select which ingress this resource should be configured on kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \"nginx-internal\" # Indicate the ingress SHOULD speak TLS between itself and pods (best-practice) ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: \"HTTPS\" name: myapp-server-internal spec: rules: - host: \"myapp.myproject.homeoffice.gov.uk\" http: paths: - backend: serviceName: myapp servicePort: 8000 path: / tls: - hosts: - \"myapp.myproject.homeoffice.gov.uk\" # the name of the kubernetes secret in your namespace with tls.crt and tls.key secretName: myapp-github-internal-tls Please view the official documentation for a full list of available ingress-nginx annotations . Note: Where the prefix for the annotation in the docs references nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ , this should be changed to ingress.kubernetes.io/ when running within ACP (as per the above example). Cert Manager # The ACP platform presently has two certificate management services. The first contender was kube-cert-manager , however with the forever changing landscape the project gradually became deprecated and now recommends replacement with cert-manager . Note ACP will continue to support the kube-cert-manager and the internal cfssl service while they are still in use, we do however recommend shifting over to the cert-manager as aside from security fixes we won't be performing anymore updates to these services. Without wishing to duplicate documentation which can be found in the readme and or official documentation , the cert-manager can effectively replace two services. kube-cert-manager: used to acquire certificates from LetsEncrypt. cfssl: an internal Cloudflare service used to generate internal certificate (usaually to encrypt between ingress and pod) . How-tos # As a developer I already have a certificate from the legacy kube-cert-manger, can I migrate? Migrating from the former kube-cert-manager over to cert-manager means creating the certificate request as below and removing the annotations from the ingress. However, the safe way would be to; Create a new Certificate resource and point to a new secret name (thus keeping the old one incase) . Push out the change and wait for the certificate to be fulfilled. Once you have the certificate you can update your ingress to use the new secret, remove the annotations and use the Certificate resource thereafter. As a developer I want to retrieve an internal certificate As stated above the cert-manager can also handle internal certificates i.e. those signing the internal ACP Certificate Authority (this is self signed btw) . At the moment you might be using cfssl-sidekick to perform this, but this can be completely replaced. apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: Certificate metadata: name: tls spec: secretName: tls issuerRef: name: platform-tls kind: ClusterIssuer commonName: site.svc.project.cluster.local dnsNames: - localhost - 127.0.0.1 This would create a kubernetes secret named tls in your namespace with the signed certificate. An interesting thing to note here although this is using the ClusterIssuer platform-ca created by the ACP team, there is nothing stopping a project from creating a local Issuer for the own project. So for example. --- apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: Issuer metadata: name: project-ca spec: ca: secretName: project-ca --- apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: Certificate metadata: name: tls spec: secretName: tls issuerRef: name: project-ca # @Note: we have change from ClusterIssuer to a local Issuer kind: Issuer commonName: site.svc.project.cluster.local dnsNames: - localhost - 127.0.0.1 As a developer I want to retrieve a certificate for my external service Lets assume we have an externally facing site which we wish to expose via ingress and we want a valid Letsencrypt certificate. Two things to note here; the enable annotation certmanager.k8s.io/enabled which is a toggle to ask cert-manager to handle this ingress resource. the Letsencrypt challenge certmanager.k8s.io/acme-challenge-type ; note, technically the challenge is not required as http01 is the default type, but I'm adding to highlight. When to use a HTTP challenge Assuming the site is externally facing i.e. the ingress class on the ingress is kubernetes.io/ingress.class: ingress-external you should always default to using a http01 challenge. Things change, however, when the site is internal / behind the vpn. In order to handle the challenge when behind the VPN you need to switch to using a DNS challenge. With ingress this is done by adding the annotation certmanager.k8s.io/acme-challenge-type: dns . Very Important this assumes you have contacted the ACP beforehand and we have either added the domain to our route53 or added the dns provider as a challenge provider. apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: annotations: # @NOTE: we choose http challenge certmanager.k8s.io/acme-challenge-type: http01 # @NOTE: this will enable the cert-manager to handle this resource certmanager.k8s.io/enabled: \"true\" ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: cookie ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: \"true\" ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: \"HTTPS\" ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: ingress ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: \"true\" kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx-external name: example spec: rules: - host: www.example.com http: paths: - backend: serviceName: service_name servicePort: 10443 path: / tls: - hosts: - www.example.com # @NOTE: this is the name of the kubernetes secret to create in your namespace secretName: example-tls A few things to note here; the cert-manager works with the custom resource Certificate when using ingress annotation what the cert-manager is doing is using another internal controller to pick up the ingress resources and create a Certificate resource on your behalf. Of course you can instead define this directly yourself. apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: Certificate metadata: name: example spec: acme: config: - domains: - www.example.com http01: ingressClass: nginx-external commonName: www.example.com dnsNames: - www.example.com issuerRef: kind: ClusterIssuer # we support letsencrypt-prod and letsencrypt-staging name: letsencrypt-prod secretName: example-tls You can review, get, list and describe the Certificate like any other kubernetes resource within your namespace. $ kubectl -n project get certificate NAME AGE example-tls 1d # you can also review the order and challenge via $ kubectl -n project get orders $ kubectl -n project get challenge Network Policies In order to handle the http01 challenge the requestor is provided an ephermal token which must be handled back to LetsEncrypt on the path http://domain/.well-known/acme-challenge/ , thus validating to them you own the domain's your requesting for. Cert-manager handles the http01 resolver by; creating a order resource within the namespace. a controller pick up the order and creates a challenge resource from it, creating an ephermal pod, service and ingress in your namespace and routing the /.well-known/acme-challenge/ . the controller checks the path/s has been provision via the ingress beforehand and validates the order, the certificate controller is then free to inform letsencrypt to call us back. it continues to probe the request and once validated, pulls down the certificate. IMPORTANT All this requires the user's to add a network policy to permit the callback, as ACP by default denies all traffic. # This default policy permits access for LetsEncrypt to resolve the http01 challenges from the ACME pods kind: NetworkPolicy apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: permit-certmanager-acme spec: policyTypes: - Ingress podSelector: matchExpressions: - {key: certmanager.k8s.io/acme-http-domain, operator: Exists} - {key: certmanager.k8s.io/acme-http-token, operator: Exists} ingress: - from: - namespaceSelector: matchLabels: name: ingress-external - podSelector: matchLabels: name: ingress ports: - protocol: TCP port: 8089 As a developer I want to retrieve a certificate for a service behind the vpn, or simple wish to use the DNS validation As stated above in order to retrieve a certificate for sites which are not externally facing we need to switch to a DNS challenge. Please ensure you have contacted the ACP team before attempting this as the correct permission need to exist to permit the cert-manager to add records to the domain. apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: Certificate metadata: name: example-tls spec: secretName: example-tls issuerRef: name: letsencrypt-prod kind: ClusterIssuer commonName: mysite.example.com dnsNames: - example.com acme: config: - dns01: provider: route53 domains: - mysite.example.com - example.com Or via ingress you would use apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: annotations: certmanager.k8s.io/acme-challenge-type: dns01 certmanager.k8s.io/acme-dns01-provider: route53 certmanager.k8s.io/enabled: \"true\" kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx-internal name: example spec: rules: - host: mysite.example.com http: paths: - backend: serviceName: service_name servicePort: 443 path: / tls: - hosts: - mysite.example.com - example.com secretName: example-tls Getting a Kubernetes Robot Token # Users Log into the Platform Hub . Go to the Projects section and find your project. Click on the Services tab and find the service that requires a robot token. Go to the Kube Robot Tokens tab. Any robot tokens that have been created for that service will be listed. You can see the full token by clicking on the eye icon next to the token. If there are no robot tokens for that service, or the required one is not there, you will need to ask your project admin(s) to create a robot token. Project Admins (Creating a robot token) Log into the Platform Hub . Go to the Projects section and find your project. Click on the Services tab and find the service that requires a robot token. Go to the Kube Robot Tokens tab and click the Create a Kubernetes robot token for this service button. Select the required cluster, RBAC group(s), robot name and description for the robot token and click Create . An explanation of RBAC groups can be found here: RBAC Groups Users who are part of the project will be able to view the token in the same place you created it (Project -> Service -> Kube Robot Tokens). Getting a Kubernetes Token # Users Log into the Platform Hub . Go to the Projects section and find your project. On the Overview & People tab, you should see a list of team members and the project admin (who will have the admin tag next to their name). Talk to your project admin and ask them to generate a user token for you. Once your token has been created, you will be able to find it in the Connected Identities section. You will need to expand the Kubernetes identity and show your full token by clicking the eye icon next to it. Project Admins (Creating a user token) Log into the Platform Hub . Go to the Projects section and find your project. Click on the Kube User Tokens tab, click Select a project team member and select the requesters name from the list. Click CREATE A NEW KUBERNETES USER TOKEN FOR THIS USER . Select the required cluster and RBAC group(s) needed for the token and click Create . An explanation of RBAC groups can be found here: RBAC Groups Once the token is created the requester should be able to see it in their Connected Identities section for use in their Kube config. Note: Tokens can take a while to propagate so you may have to wait for up to 10 minutes before using a new token. Network Policies # By default a deny-all policy is applied to every namespace in each cluster. You can however add network policies to your own projects to allow for certain connections and these will be applied on top of the default deny-all policy. Here is an example network policy for allowing a connection from the ingress-internal namespace: apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: ingress-network-policy namespace: <your-namespace-here> spec: podSelector: matchLabels: role: artifactory ingress: - from: - namespaceSelector: matchLabels: name: ingress-internal ports: - protocol: TCP port: 443 The port number should be the same as the one that your service is listening on. Controlling Egress Traffic Kubernetes v1.8 with Calico v2.6 adds support to limit egress traffic via the use of Kubernetes Network Policies. An example of a policy document blocking ALL egress traffic for a given namespace is below: apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: deny-all-egress namespace: <your-namespace-here> spec: podSelector: matchLabels: {} policyTypes: - Egress NOTE: The above document will also prevent DNS access for all pods in the namespace. To allow DNS egress traffic via the kube-system namespace, you can apply the following Network Policy document within your namespace (which takes precedence over deny-all-egress ): apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: allow-dns-access namespace: <your-namespace-here> spec: podSelector: matchLabels: {} policyTypes: - Egress egress: - to: - namespaceSelector: matchLabels: name: kube-system ports: - protocol: UDP port: 53 For more information, please see the following: - Kubernetes documentation on network policies - Kubernetes advanced network policy examples Run Performance Tests on a service hosted on ACP # As a Service, I should: Always have a baseline set of metrics of my isolated service Understand what those metrics need to be for each functionality i.e. how long file uploads should take vs a generic GET request Make sure the baseline does not include any other components i.e. networks, infrastructure etc. Expose a set of metrics, see Metrics Make performance testing part of my Continuous Integration workflow Have a history of performance over time Assessed tools summary: An example usage of Blazemeter's Taurus in a drone pipeline can be seen in the taurus-project-x repo . Artillery ( npm ) was also tested w/ the statsd plugin , visualising data in grafana. SonarQube plugin jmeter-sonar is now deprecated. The latest version of sonarqube does not to have plugin support for jmeter another option is k6 - tool is written in go and tests are written in javascript. To visualise the only option is InfluxDB and Grafana. Pod Security Policies # By default all user deployments will inherit a default PodSecurityPolicy applied accross our Kubernetes clusters, which define a set of conditions that a pod must be configured with in order to run successfully. runAsUser This condition requires that the pod specification deploys an image with a non-root user. The user defined in the specification (image spec OR pod spec) must be numeric, so that Kubernetes will be able to verify that it is a non-root user. If this is not done, you may receive any of the following errors in your event log and your pod will be prevented from starting up successfully: - container's runAsUser breaks non-root policy - container has runAsNonRoot and image will run as root - container has runAsNonRoot and image has non-numeric user <username>, cannot verify user is non-root Note: You can view all recent events in your namespace by running the following command: kubectl -n my-namespace get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp . To update your deployment accordingly for the above condition, there are multiple ways to achieve this: Dockerfile Within the Dockerfile for the image you are attempting to run, ensure the USER specified references the User ID rather than the username itself. For example: FROM quay.io/gambol99/keycloak-proxy:v2.1.1 LABEL maintainer=\"rohith.jayawardene@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk\" RUN adduser -D -u 1000 keycloak USER 1000 Note: The following common images have been updated to reference the UID within their respective Dockerfiles. If you use any of these images, updating your deployments to use these versions (or any newer versions) will meet the MustRunAsNonRoot requirement for this particular container: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/cfssl-sidekick:v0.0.6 quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/elasticsearch:v1.5.3 quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/jira:v7.9.1 quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/keycloak:v3.4.3-2 quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/kibana:v0.4.4 quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/go-keycloak-proxy:v2.1.1 quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/nginx-proxy:v3.2.9 quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/nginx-proxy-govuk:v3.2.9.0 quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/redis:v0.1.2 quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/squidproxy:v0.0.5 Deployment Spec In the securityContext section of your deployment spec, the runAsUser field can be used to set a UID that the image should be run as. An example spec would include: spec: securityContext: fsGroup: 1000 runAsNonRoot: true runAsUser: 1000 containers: - name: \"{{ .IMAGE_NAME }}\" image: \"{{ .IMAGE }}:{{ .VERSION }}\" ... Using artifactory as a private npm registry # A step-by-step guide. This guide makes the following assumptions: you have drone ci set up for your project already you are using node@8 and npm@5 or later you are connected to ACP VPN Setting up a local environment Get your username and API key from artifactory Visit https://artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/webapp/#/profile, make a note of your username, and if you don't already have an API key then generate one. base64 encode your API key echo -n <api key> | base64 Set local environment variables Copy your encoded password, and set the following environment variables in your bash profile: export NPM_AUTH_USERNAME=<username> export NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=<base64 encoded api key> You might then need to source your profile to load these environment variables. Setting up CI in drone Request a bot token for artifactory You can do this through the ACP Support Portal . One of the ACP team will create a token and send it to you as an encrypted gpg file via email. Decrypt the token gpg --decrypt ./path/to/file.gpg Add the token to drone as a secret First, base64 encode the token: echo -n \"<token>\" | base64 Then add this token to drone as a secret: drone secret add UKHomeOffice/<repo> NPM_AUTH_TOKEN <base64-encoded-token> --event pull_request Note: You will need to make sure the event types are lowercase. If an event is capitalised, it won't match the standard events inside of drone Note: you will need to make the secret available to pull request builds to be able to run npm commands in pull request steps Expose secret to build steps You will need to configure any steps which use npm to be able to access the secret. Do this by adding a secret property to those steps as follows: my_step: image: node:8 secrets: - npm_auth_token commands: - npm install - npm test Expose username to build steps In addition, you will need to add the username (as you provided when creating your token) as an environment variable. The easiest way to do this is as a \"matrix\" variable, which makes the username available to all steps without needing to configure them all individually. matrix: NPM_AUTH_USERNAME: - <username> Publishing modules to artifactory It is generally recommended to use a common namespace to publish your modules under. npm allows namespace specific configuration, which makes it easier to ensure that modules are always installed from artifactory, and will not accidentally try to install a public module with the same name. Setting publish registry Add publishConfig to package.json. This ensures that the module can only ever be published to the private registry, and misconfiguration won't accidentally make it public \"publishConfig\": { \"registry\": \"https://artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/\" } Add auth settings In your project's .npmrc file (create one if it does not already exist) add the following lines: //artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/:username=${NPM_AUTH_USERNAME} //artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/:_password=${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN} //artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/:email=test@example.com The email address can be anything, it just needs to be set. Add publish step to drone Add the following step to your .drone.yml file to publish a new version whenever you release a tag. publish: image: node:8 secrets: - npm_auth_token commands: - npm publish when: event: tag Now, when you push new tags to github then drone should publish them to the artifactory npm registry automatically. Using modules from artifactory as dependencies Configure your project to use artifactory In the project which is has private modules as dependencies, add the following line to .npmrc in the root of the project (create this file if it does not exist). @<namespace>:registry = https://artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/ This will ensure that any module under that namespace will only ever install from artifactory, and never from the public registry If using multiple namespaces then add a line for each namespace. If the modules you are installing are not namespaced in artifactory, you can add the line with the namespace removed (i.e. registry = ... ) but this will have a negative impact on install speed. You should then add the following line to your project's .npmrc if they are not already there: //artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/:username=${NPM_AUTH_USERNAME} //artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/:_password=${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN} You should now be able to install modules from artifactory into your local development environment. Installing dependencies in docker If you build a docker image as part of your CI pipeline, you will need to copy the .npmrc file into your image before installing there. Example Dockerfile : FROM quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/nodejs-base:v8 ARG NPM_AUTH_USERNAME ARG NPM_AUTH_TOKEN COPY .npmrc /app/.npmrc COPY package.json /app/package.json COPY package-lock.json /app/package-lock.json RUN npm install --production --no-optional COPY . /app USER nodejs CMD node index.js When building the image, you will then need to pass the username and token variables into docker with the --build-arg flag. docker build --build-arg NPM_AUTH_USERNAME=$${NPM_AUTH_USERNAME} --build-arg NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=$${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN} . Provisioned Volumes and Storage Classes # In order to use volumes with your pod, we use kubernetes provisioned volume claims and storage classes, to read more about this please see Kubernetes Dynamic Provisioning . On each cluster in ACP, we have the the following storage classes for you to use: gp2-encrypted gp2-encrypted-eu-west-2a gp2-encrypted-eu-west-2b gp2-encrypted-eu-west-2c io1-encrypted-eu-west-2 io1-encrypted-eu-west-2a io1-encrypted-eu-west-2b io1-encrypted-eu-west-2c st1-encrypted-eu-west-2 st1-encrypted-eu-west-2a st1-encrypted-eu-west-2b st1-encrypted-eu-west-2c The io1-* (provisioned iops) storage classes have iopsPerGB: \"50\" Backups for EBS Once the ebs has been created, if you'd like to enable EBS snapshots for backups, please raise a ticket via the Support Portal so that we can add AWS tags to the volume, which will be picked up by ebs-snapshot . TLS Passthrough # There are occasions when you don't want the TLS to be terminated on the ingress and prefer to terminate in the pod instead. Note, by terminating in the pod the ingress will no longer be able to perform any L7 actions, so all of the feature set is lost (effectively it's become a TLS proxy using SNI to route the traffic) Example steps First create a kubernetes secret containing the certificate you wish to use. $ kubectl create secret tls tls --cert=cert.pem --key=cert-key.pem Create the deployment and service. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: labels: name: tls-passthrough name: tls-passthrough spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: https port: 443 protocol: TCP targetPort: 10443 selector: name: tls-passthrough --- --- apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: tls-passthrough spec: replicas: 1 strategy: type: RollingUpdate rollingUpdate: maxUnavailable: 1 template: metadata: labels: name: tls-passthrough spec: volumes: - name: certs secret: secretName: tls containers: - name: proxy image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/nginx-proxy:v3.2.0 ports: - name: https containerPort: 10443 protocol: TCP env: - name: PROXY_SERVICE_HOST value: \"127.0.0.1\" - name: PROXY_SERVICE_PORT value: \"8080\" - name: SERVER_CERT value: /certs/tls.crt - name: SERVER_KEY value: /certs/tls.key - name: ENABLE_UUID_PARAM value: \"FALSE\" - name: NAXSI_USE_DEFAULT_RULES value: \"FALSE\" - name: PORT_IN_HOST_HEADER value: \"FALSE\" volumeMounts: - name: certs mountPath: /certs readOnly: true - name: fake-application image: kennethreitz/httpbin:latest Push out the ingress resource indicating you want ssl-passthrough enabled. --- apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: annotations: ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: \"true\" kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \"nginx-external\" name: tls-passthrough spec: rules: - host: tls-passthrough.notprod.homeoffice.gov.uk http: paths: - backend: serviceName: tls-passthrough servicePort: 443 path: / Writing Dockerfiles # Dockerfile best practice We recommend familiarising yourself with Docker's excellent guidance on this topic.

At present network access in ACP is provided via Calico, but this becomes redundant when the traffic egresses the cluster. Simply peering networks together either through VPC peering or VPN connections doesn't provide the controls we want.

How-tos # As a developer I already have a certificate from the legacy kube-cert-manger, can I migrate? Migrating from the former kube-cert-manager over to cert-manager means creating the certificate request as below and removing the annotations from the ingress. However, the safe way would be to; Create a new Certificate resource and point to a new secret name (thus keeping the old one incase) . Push out the change and wait for the certificate to be fulfilled. Once you have the certificate you can update your ingress to use the new secret, remove the annotations and use the Certificate resource thereafter. As a developer I want to retrieve an internal certificate As stated above the cert-manager can also handle internal certificates i.e. those signing the internal ACP Certificate Authority (this is self signed btw) . At the moment you might be using cfssl-sidekick to perform this, but this can be completely replaced. apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: Certificate metadata: name: tls spec: secretName: tls issuerRef: name: platform-tls kind: ClusterIssuer commonName: site.svc.project.cluster.local dnsNames: - localhost - 127.0.0.1 This would create a kubernetes secret named tls in your namespace with the signed certificate. An interesting thing to note here although this is using the ClusterIssuer platform-ca created by the ACP team, there is nothing stopping a project from creating a local Issuer for the own project. So for example. --- apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: Issuer metadata: name: project-ca spec: ca: secretName: project-ca --- apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: Certificate metadata: name: tls spec: secretName: tls issuerRef: name: project-ca # @Note: we have change from ClusterIssuer to a local Issuer kind: Issuer commonName: site.svc.project.cluster.local dnsNames: - localhost - 127.0.0.1 As a developer I want to retrieve a certificate for my external service Lets assume we have an externally facing site which we wish to expose via ingress and we want a valid Letsencrypt certificate. Two things to note here; the enable annotation certmanager.k8s.io/enabled which is a toggle to ask cert-manager to handle this ingress resource. the Letsencrypt challenge certmanager.k8s.io/acme-challenge-type ; note, technically the challenge is not required as http01 is the default type, but I'm adding to highlight. When to use a HTTP challenge Assuming the site is externally facing i.e. the ingress class on the ingress is kubernetes.io/ingress.class: ingress-external you should always default to using a http01 challenge. Things change, however, when the site is internal / behind the vpn. In order to handle the challenge when behind the VPN you need to switch to using a DNS challenge. With ingress this is done by adding the annotation certmanager.k8s.io/acme-challenge-type: dns . Very Important this assumes you have contacted the ACP beforehand and we have either added the domain to our route53 or added the dns provider as a challenge provider. apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: annotations: # @NOTE: we choose http challenge certmanager.k8s.io/acme-challenge-type: http01 # @NOTE: this will enable the cert-manager to handle this resource certmanager.k8s.io/enabled: \"true\" ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: cookie ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: \"true\" ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: \"HTTPS\" ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: ingress ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: \"true\" kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx-external name: example spec: rules: - host: www.example.com http: paths: - backend: serviceName: service_name servicePort: 10443 path: / tls: - hosts: - www.example.com # @NOTE: this is the name of the kubernetes secret to create in your namespace secretName: example-tls A few things to note here; the cert-manager works with the custom resource Certificate when using ingress annotation what the cert-manager is doing is using another internal controller to pick up the ingress resources and create a Certificate resource on your behalf. Of course you can instead define this directly yourself. apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: Certificate metadata: name: example spec: acme: config: - domains: - www.example.com http01: ingressClass: nginx-external commonName: www.example.com dnsNames: - www.example.com issuerRef: kind: ClusterIssuer # we support letsencrypt-prod and letsencrypt-staging name: letsencrypt-prod secretName: example-tls You can review, get, list and describe the Certificate like any other kubernetes resource within your namespace. $ kubectl -n project get certificate NAME AGE example-tls 1d # you can also review the order and challenge via $ kubectl -n project get orders $ kubectl -n project get challenge Network Policies In order to handle the http01 challenge the requestor is provided an ephermal token which must be handled back to LetsEncrypt on the path http://domain/.well-known/acme-challenge/ , thus validating to them you own the domain's your requesting for. Cert-manager handles the http01 resolver by; creating a order resource within the namespace. a controller pick up the order and creates a challenge resource from it, creating an ephermal pod, service and ingress in your namespace and routing the /.well-known/acme-challenge/ . the controller checks the path/s has been provision via the ingress beforehand and validates the order, the certificate controller is then free to inform letsencrypt to call us back. it continues to probe the request and once validated, pulls down the certificate. IMPORTANT All this requires the user's to add a network policy to permit the callback, as ACP by default denies all traffic. # This default policy permits access for LetsEncrypt to resolve the http01 challenges from the ACME pods kind: NetworkPolicy apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: permit-certmanager-acme spec: policyTypes: - Ingress podSelector: matchExpressions: - {key: certmanager.k8s.io/acme-http-domain, operator: Exists} - {key: certmanager.k8s.io/acme-http-token, operator: Exists} ingress: - from: - namespaceSelector: matchLabels: name: ingress-external - podSelector: matchLabels: name: ingress ports: - protocol: TCP port: 8089 As a developer I want to retrieve a certificate for a service behind the vpn, or simple wish to use the DNS validation As stated above in order to retrieve a certificate for sites which are not externally facing we need to switch to a DNS challenge.

Debugging issues with your deployments to the platform If you get to the end of the above guide but can't access your application there are a number of places something could be going wrong. This section of the guide aims to give you some basic starting points for how to debug your application. Debugging deployments We suggest the following steps: 1. Check your deployment, replicaset and pods created properly $ kubectl get deployments $ kubectl get rs $ kubectl get pods 2. Investigate potential issues with your pods (this is most likely) If the get pods command shows that your pods aren't all running then this is likely where the issue is. You can then try curling your application to see if it is alive and responding as expected. e.g. $ curl localhost:4000 You can get further details on why the pods couldn't be deployed by running: $ kubectl describe pods *pods_name_here* If your pods are running you can check they are operating as expected by exec ing into them (this gets you a shell on one of your containers). $ kubectl exec -ti *pods_name_here* -c *container_name_here* /bin/sh Please note that the -c argument isn't needed if there is only one container in the pod.* 3. Investigate potential issues with your service A good way to do this is to run a container in your namespace with a bash terminal: $ kubectl run -ti --image quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/centos-base debugger bash From this container you can then try curling your service. Your service will have a nice DNS name by default, so you can for example run: $ curl my-service-name 4. Investigate potential issues with ingress Minikube runs an ingress service using nginx. It's possible to ssh into the nginx container and cat the nginx.conf to inspect the configuration for nginx.

AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) RDS resources can be transitioned to a stopped state OOH to save on resource utilisation costs. This is currently managed with the use of tags on the RDS instance defining a cronjob schedule to stop and start the instance. To set a schedule for your RDS instances, please use the related Support Portal support request template . Note: Shutting down an RDS instance will have cost savings based on the instance size, however you will still be charged for the allocated storage. Kubernetes Pods Automatically scale down Kubernetes Deployments & Statefulsets to 0 replicas during non-working hours for Non-Production or Production Environments. Downscaling for Deployments & Statefulsets are managed by an annotation set within the manifest, and are processed every 30 seconds for changes, by a service running within the Kubernetes Clusters. Usage Set ONE of the following annotations on your Deployment / Statefulset: - downscaler/uptime : A time schedule in which the Deployment should be scaled up - downscaler/downtime : A time schedule in which the Deployment should be scaled down to 0 replicas The annotation values for the timeframe must have the following format to be processed correctly: <WEEKDAY-FROM>-<WEEKDAY-TO-INCLUSIVE> <HH>:<MM>-<HH>:<MM> <TIMEZONE> For example, to schedule a Deployment to only run on weekdays during working hours, the following annotation would be set: downscaler/uptime: Mon-Fri 09:00-17:30 Europe/London Note: When the deployment is downscaled, an additional annotation downscaler/original-replicas is automatically set to retain a history of the desired replicas prior to the downscale action. If this annotation has been deleted before the service is automatically scaled back up, the downscaler service will not know what to set the replicas back to, and so it won't attempt to scale up the resource.

At the time of writing, we are using version 0.8 of Drone. You can also install a release from Drone CLI's GitHub repo . Once you have downloaded the relevant file, extract it and move it to the /usr/local/bin directory. Verify it works as expected: $ drone --version drone version 0.8.0 Export the DRONE_SERVER and DRONE_TOKEN variables. You can find your token on Drone by clicking the icon in the top right corner and going to Token . export DRONE_SERVER=https://drone.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk export DRONE_TOKEN=<your_drone_token> If your installation is successful, you should be able to query the current Drone instance: $ drone info User: youruser Email: youremail@gmail.com If the output is bash Error: you must provide the Drone server address. or Error: you must provide your Drone access token. Please make sure that you have exported the DRONE_SERVER and DRONE_TOKEN variables properly. Activate your pipeline Once you are logged in to Drone, you will find a list of repos by clicking the icon in the top right corner and going to Repositories . Sync your repository access rights with Drone by clicking the icon in the top right corner again with the Synchronize button - this needs to be applied everytime when a new repository is created. Select the repo you want to activate. Navigate to your repository's settings in Github (or Gitlab) and you will see a webhook has been created. You need to update the url for the newly created web hook so that it matches this pattern: https://drone-external.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk/hook?access_token=some_token If it is already in that format there is no need to change anything. The token in the payload url will not be the same as the personal token that you exported and it should be left unchanged. Please note that this does not apply to Gitlab. When you activate the repo in Drone, you should not change anything for a Gitlab repo. Configure your pipeline In the root folder of your project, create a .drone.yml file with the following content: pipeline: my-build: image: docker:18.03 environment: - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 commands: - docker build -t <image_name> . when: branch: master event: push Commit and push your changes: $ git add .drone.yml $ git commit $ git push origin master Please note you should replace the name <...> with the name of your app. You should be able to watch your build succeed in the Drone UI. Publishing Docker images Publishing to Quay If your repository is hosted on Gitlab, you don't want to publish your images to Quay. Images published to Quay are public and can be inspected and downloaded by anyone. You should publish your private images to Artifactory . Register for a free Quay account using your Github account linked to the Home Office organisation. Once you've logged into Quay check that you have ukhomeofficedigital under Users and Organisations. If you do not, submit a support request on the support portal for access to the ukhomeoffice organisation . Once you have access to view the ukhomeofficedigital repositories, click repositories and click the + Create New Repositories that is: public empty - no need to create a repo from a Dockerfile or link it to an existing repository Add your project to the UKHomeOffice Quay account and submit a support request on the support portal for a new Quay robot . Add the step to publish the docker image to Quay in your Drone pipeline: image_to_quay: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/drone-docker secrets: - docker_password environment: - DOCKER_USERNAME=ukhomeofficedigital+<your_robot_username> registry: quay.io repo: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/<your_quay_repo> tags: - ${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} - latest when: branch: master event: push Where <your_quay_repo> in: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/<your_quay_repo> is the name of the Quay repo you (should) have already created. Note: ${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} is a Drone environment variable that is passed to the container at runtime. The build should fail with the following error: Error response from daemon: Get https://quay.io/v2/: unauthorized: Could not find robot with username: ukhomeofficedigital+<your_robot_username> and supplied password. The error points to the missing password for the Quay robot. You will need to add this as a drone secret. You can do this through the Drone UI by going to your repo, clicking the menu icon in the top right and then clicking Secrets . You should be presented with a list of the secrets for that repo (if there are any) and you should be able to add secrets giving them a name and value. Add a secret with the name DOCKER_PASSWORD and with the value being the robot token that was supplied to you. Alternatively, you can use the Drone CLI to add the secret: $ drone secret add --repository ukhomeoffice/<your_github_repo> --name DOCKER_PASSWORD --value <your_robot_token> Restarting the build should be enough to make it pass. The Drone CLI allows for more control over the secret as opposed to the UI. For example, the CLI allows you to specify the image and the events that the secret will be allowed to be used with. Also note that the secret was specified in the secrets section of the pipeline to give it access to the secret. Without this, the pipeline would not be able to use the secret and it would fail. Secrets in this section are automatically uppercased at runtime so it is important that the secret is uppercased in your commands. You can also push specifically tagged images by using the DRONE_TAG Drone environment variable and by using the tag event: tagged_image_to_quay: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/drone-docker secrets: - docker_password environment: - DOCKER_USERNAME=ukhomeofficedigital+<your_robot_username> registry: quay.io repo: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/<your_quay_repo> tags: - ${DRONE_TAG} when: event: tag Tag using git tag v1.0 and push your tag with git push origin v1.0 (replace v1.0 with the tag you actually want to use). Note: These pipeline configurations are using the Docker plugin for Drone. For more information, see http://plugins.drone.io/drone-plugins/drone-docker/ Publishing to Artifactory Images hosted on Artifactory are private. If your repository is hosted publicly on GitHub, you shouldn't publish your images to Artifactory. Artifactory is only used to publish private images. You should use Quay to publish your public images . Submit a support request for a new Artifactory access token . You should be supplied an access token in response. You can inject the token that has been supplied to you with: $ drone secret add --repository <gitlab_repo_group>/<your_gitlab_repo> --name DOCKER_PASSWORD --value <your_robot_token> You can add the following step in your .drone.yml : image_to_artifactory: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/drone-docker secrets: - docker_password environment: - DOCKER_USERNAME=<your_robots_username> registry: docker.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk repo: docker.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/<your_artifactory_repo> tags: - ${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} - latest when: branch: master event: push Where the <image_name> in: docker tag <image_name> docker.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/ukhomeofficedigital/<your_artifactory_repo>:$${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} is the name of the image you tagged previously in the build step. The image should now be published on Artifactory. Please note that we regularly remove container images that have not been downloaded in a year. Deployments Deployments and promotions Create a step that runs only on deployments: deploy-to-preprod: image: busybox commands: - /bin/echo hello preprod when: environment: preprod event: deployment Push the changes to your remote repository. You can deploy the build you just pushed with the following command: $ drone deploy ukhomeoffice/<your_repo> 16 preprod Where 16 is the successful build number on drone that you wish to deploy to the preprod environment. You can pass additional parameters to your deployment as environment variables: $ drone deploy ukhomeoffice/<your_repo> 16 preprod -p DEBUG=1 -p NAME=Dan and use them in the step like this: deploy-to-preprod: image: busybox commands: - /bin/echo hello $${NAME} when: environment: preprod event: deployment Environments are strings and can be set to any value. When you wish to deploy to several environments you can create a step for each one of them: deploy-to-preprod: image: busybox commands: - /bin/echo hello preprod when: environment: preprod event: deployment deploy-to-prod: image: busybox commands: - /bin/echo hello prod when: environment: prod event: deployment And deploy them accordingly: $ drone deploy ukhomeoffice/<your_repo> 16 preprod $ drone deploy ukhomeoffice/<your_repo> 16 prod Read more on environments . Drone as a Pull Request builder Drone pipelines are triggered when events occurs. Event triggers can be as simple as a push , a tagged commit , a pull request or as granular as only for pull requests for a branch named test . You can limit the execution of build steps at runtime using the when block. As an example, this block executes only on pull requests: pr-builder: image: docker:18.03 environment: - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 commands: - docker build -t <image_name> . when: event: pull_request Drone will only execute that step when a new pull request is raised (and when pushes are made to the branch while a pull request is open). Read more about Drone conditions . Deploying to ACP Please note that this section assumes that you already have kube files to work with (specifically, deployment, service and ingress files). Examples of these files can be found in the kube-signed-commit-check project. Add a deployment script with the following: #!/bin/bash export KUBE_NAMESPACE=<dev-induction> export KUBE_SERVER=${KUBE_SERVER} export KUBE_TOKEN=${KUBE_TOKEN} kd -f deployment.yaml \\ -f service.yaml \\ -f ingress.yaml Please note that this is only an example script and it will need to be changed to fit your particular application's needs. If you deployed this now you would likely receive an error similar to this: error: You must be logged in to the server (the server has asked for the client to provide credentials) This error appears because kd needs 3 environment variables to be set before deploying: KUBE_NAMESPACE - The kubernetes namespace you wish to deploy to. You need to provide the kubernetes namespace as part of the deployment job . KUBE_TOKEN - This is the token used to authenticate against the kubernetes cluster. If you do not already have a kube token, here are docs explaining how to get one . KUBE_SERVER - This is the address of the kubernetes cluster that you want to deploy to. You will need to add KUBE_TOKEN and KUBE_SERVER as drone secrets. Information about how to add Drone secrets can be found in the publishing to Quay section . You can verify that the secrets for your repo are present with: $ drone secret ls --repository ukhomeoffice/<your-repo> Once the secrets have been added, add a new step to your drone pipeline that will execute the deployment script: deploy_to_uat: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/kd:v0.11.0 secrets: - kube_server - kube_token commands: - ./deploy.sh when: environment: uat event: deployment Using Another Repo It is possible to access files or deployment scripts from another repo, there are two ways of doing this. The recommended method is to clone another repo in the current repo (since this only requires maintaining one .drone.yml) using the following step: predeploy_to_uat: image: plugins/git commands: - git clone https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}:x-oauth-basic@github.com/UKHomeOffice/<your_repo>.git when: environment: uat event: deployment Your repository is saved in the workspace, which in turn is shared among all steps in the pipeline. However, if you decide that you want to trigger a completely different pipeline on a separate repository, you can leverage the drone-trigger plugin. If you have a secondary repository, you can setup Drone on that repository like so: pipeline: deploy_to_uat: image: busybox commands: - echo ${SHA} when: event: deployment environment: uat Once you are ready, you can push the changes to the remote repository. In your main repository you can add the following step: trigger_deploy: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/drone-trigger:latest drone_server: https://drone.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk repo: UKHomeOffice/<deployment_repo> branch: <master> deploy_to: <uat> params: SHA=${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} when: event: deployment environment: uat The settings are very similar to the drone deploy command: deploy_to is the environment constraint params is a list of comma separated list of arguments. In the command line tool, this is equivalent to -p PARAM1=ONE -p PARAM2=TWO repo the repository where the deployment scripts are located The next time you trigger a deployment on the main repository with: $ drone deploy UKHomeOffice/<your_repo> 16 uat This will trigger a new deployment on the second repository. Please note that in this scenario you need to inspect 2 builds on 2 separate repositories if you just want to inspect the logs. Versioned deployments When you restart your build, Drone will automatically use the latest version of the code. However always using the latest version of the deployment configuration can cause major issues and isn't recommended. For example when promoting from preprod to prod you want to use the preprod version of the deployment configuration. If you use the latest it could potentially break your production environment, especially as it won't necessarily have been tested. To counteract this you should use a specific version of your deployment scripts. In fact, you should git checkout the tag or sha as part of your deployment step. Here is an example of this: predeploy_to_uat: image: plugins/git commands: - git clone https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}:x-oauth-basic@github.com/UKHomeOffice/<your_repo>.git when: environment: uat event: deployment deploy_to_uat: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/kd:v0.11.0 secrets: - kube_server - kube_token commands: - apk update && apk add git - git checkout v1.1 - ./deploy.sh when: environment: uat event: deployment Migrating your pipeline Secrets and Signing It is no longer necessary to sign your .drone.yml so the .drone.yml.sig can be deleted. Secrets can be defined in the Drone UI or using the CLI. Secrets created using the UI will be available to push, tag and deployment events. To restrict to selected events, or to allow pull request builds to access secrets you must use the CLI. Pipelines by default do not have access to any Drone secrets that you have added. You must now define which secrets a pipeline is allowed access to in a secrets section in your pipeline. Here is an example of a pipeline that has access to the DOCKER_PASSWORD secret which will be used to push an image to Quay: image_to_quay: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/drone-docker secrets: - docker_password environment: - DOCKER_USERNAME=ukhomeofficedigital+<your_robot_username> registry: quay.io repo: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/<your_quay_repo> tags: - latest when: branch: master event: push Note: Secrets names in the secrets section will have their names uppercased at runtime. Organisation secrets are no longer available. This means that if you are using any organisation secrets such as KUBE_TOKEN_DEV , you will need to add a secret in Drone to replace it. Docker-in-Docker The Docker-in-Docker (dind) service is no longer required. Instead, change the Docker host to DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 in the environment section of your pipline, and you will be able to access the shared Docker server on the drone agent. Note that it is only possible to run one Docker build at a time per Drone agent. Since privileged mode was primarily used for docker in docker, you should remove the privileged: true line from your .drone.yml . You can also use your freshly built image directly and run commands as part of your pipeline. Example: pipeline: build_image: image: docker:18.03 environment: - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 commands: - docker build -t hello_world . when: branch: master event: push test_image: image: hello_world commands: - ./run-hello-world.sh when: branch: master event: push Services If you use the services section of your .drone.yml it is possible to reference them using the DNS name of the service. For example, if using the following section: services: database: image: mysql The mysql server would be available on tcp://database:3306 Variable Escaping Any Drone variables (secrets and environment variables) must now be escaped by having two $$ instead of one. Examples: ${DOCKER_PASSWORD} --> $${DOCKER_PASSWORD} ${DRONE_TAG} --> $${DRONE_TAG} ${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} --> $${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} Scanning Images in Drone # ACP provides Anchore as a scanning solution for images built into the Drone pipeline, allowing users to scan both ephemeral (built within the context of the drone, but not pushed to a repository yet) as well as any public images. Example pipeline: pipeline: build: image: docker:17.09.0-ce environment: - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 commands: - docker build -t docker.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/myimage:$${DRONE_BUILD_NUMBER} . scan: # The location of the drone plugin image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/anchore-submission:latest # The optional path of a Dockerfile dockerfile: Dockerfile # Note the lack of double $ here (due to the way drone injects variables) image_name: docker.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/myimage:${DRONE_BUILD_NUMBER} # Indicates the image is locally available local_image: true # This indicates we are willing tolerate any vulnerabilities which are below medium (valid values: negligible, low, medium, high, critical) tolerate: medium # An optional whitelist (comma separated list of CVE's) whitelist: CVE_SOMENAME_1,CVE_SOMENAME_2 # An optional whitelist file containing a list of CSV relative to the repo path whitelist_file: <PATH> # Indicates we should show all vulnerabilities regardless show_all_vulnerabilities: false # By default the plugin will exit will fail if any vulnerabilities are discovered which are not tolerated, # you change this behaviour by setting the below fail_on_detection: false Q&As Q: The build fails with \"ERROR: Insufficient privileges to use privileged mode\" A: Remove privileged: true from your .drone.yml . As explained in the migrating your pipeline section , the primary use of this was for Docker-in-Docker which is not required. Q: The build fails with \"Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?\" A: Make sure that your steps contain the environment variable DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 like in this case: my-build: image: docker:18.03 environment: - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2375 commands: - docker build -t <image_name> . when: branch: master event: push Q: The build fails when uploading to Quay with the error \"Error response from daemon: Get https://quay.io/v2/: unauthorized:...\" A: This is likely because the secret wasn't added correctly or the password is incorrect. Check that the secret has been added to Drone and that you have added the secrets section in your .drone.yaml it to the pipeline that requires it. Q: As part of my build process I have two Dockerfiles to produce a Docker image. How can I share files between builds in the same step? A: When the pipeline starts, Drone creates a Docker data volume that is passed along all active steps in the pipeline. If the first step creates a test.txt file, the second step can use that file. As an example, this pipeline uses a two step build process: pipeline: first-step: image: busybox commands: - echo hello > test.txt when: branch: master event: push second-step: image: busybox commands: - cat test.txt when: branch: master event: push Q: Should I use Gitlab with Quay? A: Please don't. If your repository is hosted in Gitlab then use Artifactory to publish your images. Images published to Artifactory are kept private. If you still want to use Quay, you should consider hosting your repository on the open (Github). Q: Can I create a token that has permission to create ephemeral/temporary namespaces? A: No. This is because there is currently no way to give access to namespaces via regex. I.e. There is no way to give access to any namespace with the format: my-temp-namespace-* (where * would be build number or something similar). Alternatively, you can be given a named namespace in the CI cluster.

These credentials will work across multiple projects whose Repositories you have been granted access to. With the AWS IAM Credentials retrieved from the Connected Identities page, setup a local IAM Profile via the Terminal: $ aws configure --profile acp-ecr AWS Access Key ID [None]: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX AWS Secret Access Key [None]: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Default region name [None]: eu-west-2 Default output format [None]: json $ export AWS_PROFILE=acp-ecr Now, using the aws-cli you can request an authorisation token to perform a docker login: $ aws ecr get-login --no-include-email docker login -u AWS -p <long-auth-token> https://340268328991.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com Step 2: Login with Authorisation Token Following a successful ecr get-login , a full docker login command should be returned. Copy and paste the command exactly, to login to the ECR endpoint: $ docker login -u AWS -p <long-auth-token> https://340268328991.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com WARNING! Using --password via the CLI is insecure. Use --password-stdin. Login Succeeded Note: If you get an error from Step 1 such as Unknown options: --no-include-email , your aws-cli client needs updating. You can omit --no-include-email rather than updating your aws-cli client, but the resulting docker login command will include a deprecated -e none flag (needs to be removed prior to running the command). Pulling & Pushing Images Within the ACP Kubernetes Clusters, you do not need to provide an imagePullSecret as was previously required for images in Artifactory. The ACP Clusters will authenticate behind-the-scenes and be able to successfully pull images from any Docker Repositories you create via the Platform Hub. The Docker Repositories section of the Platform Hub will provide a URL such as follows for the Repository you have created: 340268328991.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/acp/hello-world-app Now that you have locally authenticated with AWS ECR, you can pull and push (if write access was granted) images as normal: $ docker build . -t 340268328991.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/acp/hello-world-app:v0.0.1 Sending build context to Docker daemon 32.78MB ...

For example: $ aws ecr list-images --repository-name acp/hello-world-app { \"imageIds\": [ { \"imageDigest\": \"sha256:0309d2655ecef6b4181ee93edfb91f386fc2ebc7849cc88f6e7a18b0d349c35f\", \"imageTag\": \"v0.0.1\" }, { \"imageDigest\": \"sha256:0309d2655ecef6b4181ee93edfb91f386fc2ebc7849cc88f6e7a18b0d349c35f\", \"imageTag\": \"latest\" } ] } To delete old images, you must have write access enabled or perform the action via a Robot Account. Images can be deleted based on a provided tag or digest. When providing a digest, all image tags with the same digest are deleted together. $ aws ecr batch-delete-image --repository-name acp/hello-world-app --image-ids imageTag=v0.0.1 { \"imageIds\": [ { \"imageDigest\": \"sha256:0309d2655ecef6b4181ee93edfb91f386fc2ebc7849cc88f6e7a18b0d349c35f\", \"imageTag\": \"v0.0.1\" } ], \"failures\": [] } $ aws ecr batch-delete-image --repository-name acp/hello-world-app --image-ids imageDigest=sha256:0309d2655ecef6b4181ee93edfb91f386fc2ebc7849cc88f6e7a18b0d349c35f { \"imageIds\": [ { \"imageDigest\": \"sha256:0309d2655ecef6b4181ee93edfb91f386fc2ebc7849cc88f6e7a18b0d349c35f\", \"imageTag\": \"latest\" } ], \"failures\": [] } Managing Image Deployments via Drone CI The Docker Authorisation Token generated via the aws-cli command is only valid for 12 hours, and so this can't be used as a Drone Secret for Docker Image builds. Instead, you would need to store the IAM Credentials for a Robot Account as Drone Secrets and perform the aws ecr get-login + docker login .. step on each build. To simplify this process you can use a custom Drone ECR plugin, which: - Builds a docker image in the root repository directory, with custom build arguments passed in (optional) - Authenticates to ECR using your AWS IAM credentials (stored as Drone Secrets) - Pushes the image to ECR with the given tags in the list (latest and commit sha) Example Pipeline: pipeline: build_push_to_ecr: image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/ecr:latest secrets: - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY repo: 340268328991.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/acp/hello-world-app build_args: - APP_BUILD=${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} tags: - latest - ${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA} The UKHomeOffice ECR image above is based off the official Docker ECR Plugin , with amendments to run in ACP Drone CI.","title":"Elastic container registry"},{"location":"how-to-docs/elastic-container-registry.html#aws-ecr-for-private-docker-images","text":"AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) is now available as a self-service feature via the Platform Hub.

This guide makes the following assumptions: you have drone ci set up for your project already you are using node@8 and npm@5 or later you are connected to ACP VPN Setting up a local environment Get your username and API key from artifactory Visit https://artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/webapp/#/profile, make a note of your username, and if you don't already have an API key then generate one. base64 encode your API key echo -n <api key> | base64 Set local environment variables Copy your encoded password, and set the following environment variables in your bash profile: export NPM_AUTH_USERNAME=<username> export NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=<base64 encoded api key> You might then need to source your profile to load these environment variables. Setting up CI in drone Request a bot token for artifactory You can do this through the ACP Support Portal . One of the ACP team will create a token and send it to you as an encrypted gpg file via email. Decrypt the token gpg --decrypt ./path/to/file.gpg Add the token to drone as a secret First, base64 encode the token: echo -n \"<token>\" | base64 Then add this token to drone as a secret: drone secret add UKHomeOffice/<repo> NPM_AUTH_TOKEN <base64-encoded-token> --event pull_request Note: You will need to make sure the event types are lowercase. If an event is capitalised, it won't match the standard events inside of drone Note: you will need to make the secret available to pull request builds to be able to run npm commands in pull request steps Expose secret to build steps You will need to configure any steps which use npm to be able to access the secret. Do this by adding a secret property to those steps as follows: my_step: image: node:8 secrets: - npm_auth_token commands: - npm install - npm test Expose username to build steps In addition, you will need to add the username (as you provided when creating your token) as an environment variable. The easiest way to do this is as a \"matrix\" variable, which makes the username available to all steps without needing to configure them all individually. matrix: NPM_AUTH_USERNAME: - <username> Publishing modules to artifactory It is generally recommended to use a common namespace to publish your modules under. npm allows namespace specific configuration, which makes it easier to ensure that modules are always installed from artifactory, and will not accidentally try to install a public module with the same name. Setting publish registry Add publishConfig to package.json. This ensures that the module can only ever be published to the private registry, and misconfiguration won't accidentally make it public \"publishConfig\": { \"registry\": \"https://artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/\" } Add auth settings In your project's .npmrc file (create one if it does not already exist) add the following lines: //artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/:username=${NPM_AUTH_USERNAME} //artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/:_password=${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN} //artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/:email=test@example.com The email address can be anything, it just needs to be set. Add publish step to drone Add the following step to your .drone.yml file to publish a new version whenever you release a tag. publish: image: node:8 secrets: - npm_auth_token commands: - npm publish when: event: tag Now, when you push new tags to github then drone should publish them to the artifactory npm registry automatically. Using modules from artifactory as dependencies Configure your project to use artifactory In the project which is has private modules as dependencies, add the following line to .npmrc in the root of the project (create this file if it does not exist). @<namespace>:registry = https://artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/ This will ensure that any module under that namespace will only ever install from artifactory, and never from the public registry If using multiple namespaces then add a line for each namespace. If the modules you are installing are not namespaced in artifactory, you can add the line with the namespace removed (i.e. registry = ... ) but this will have a negative impact on install speed. You should then add the following line to your project's .npmrc if they are not already there: //artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/:username=${NPM_AUTH_USERNAME} //artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/:_password=${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN} You should now be able to install modules from artifactory into your local development environment. Installing dependencies in docker If you build a docker image as part of your CI pipeline, you will need to copy the .npmrc file into your image before installing there. Example Dockerfile : FROM quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/nodejs-base:v8 ARG NPM_AUTH_USERNAME ARG NPM_AUTH_TOKEN COPY .npmrc /app/.npmrc COPY package.json /app/package.json COPY package-lock.json /app/package-lock.json RUN npm install --production --no-optional COPY . /app USER nodejs CMD node index.js When building the image, you will then need to pass the username and token variables into docker with the --build-arg flag. docker build --build-arg NPM_AUTH_USERNAME=$${NPM_AUTH_USERNAME} --build-arg NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=$${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN} .","title":"Private npm registry"},{"location":"how-to-docs/private-npm-registry.html#using-artifactory-as-a-private-npm-registry","text":"A step-by-step guide.

It is often easier to build from an existing base image. To find such base images that are maintained by Home Office colleagues, you can search the UKHomeOffice organisation on Github for repos starting with \u2018docker-\u2019 - e.g.: docker-java11-mvn If you want to use a base image in the UKHomeOffice organisation that does not appear to be regularly maintained, please get in touch via the ACP Service Desk and we will arrange write access to that repo. Please make sure that any base image that you maintain adheres to the best practices set out by Docker, and includes instructions to update all existing packages - e.g.: yum install -y curl && yum clean all && rpm --rebuilddb Home Office CentOS base image If none of the technology specific images work for you, you can either build on top of them or build from the base Centos image .","title":"Write dockerfiles"},{"location":"how-to-docs/write-dockerfiles.html#writing-dockerfiles","text":"","title":"Writing Dockerfiles"}]}
